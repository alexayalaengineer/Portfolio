          Automated Pedestrian Crosswalk Warning System

          Sensor-based safety system that detects pedestrians and cyclists approaching or entering a crosswalk,
          activating yellow or red warning lights to alert drivers in low-visibility areas and improve intersection safety.

      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
        <h2 class="block-title">Overview</h2>

        <p class="principles-intro">
          Pedestrian safety remains a persistent challenge at intersections without traffic signals, where drivers often
          fail to notice pedestrians in time to yield. This project addressed that problem through the design and
          prototyping of an Automated Pedestrian Crosswalk Warning System, intended to increase driver awareness using
          clear visual cues when pedestrians approach or enter a crosswalk.
        </p>

      <!-- DEMONSTRATION -->
      <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
        <h2 class="block-title">
          Automated Pedestrian Crosswalk Warning System Demonstration
        </h2>

        <p class="principles-intro">
          The system was designed around a simple two-state warning concept. A yellow warning light activates when a
          pedestrian approaches the crosswalk, while a red warning light activates once a pedestrian is actively
          crossing. This distinction allows drivers to anticipate pedestrian movement rather than reacting at the
          last moment.

      <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
        <h2 class="block-title">Warning Light Explanation</h2>

        <p class="principles-intro">
          Pedestrian detection was achieved using a layered sensing approach. An ultrasonic sensor detected pedestrians
          approaching the crosswalk, while a passive infrared (PIR) sensor confirmed when a pedestrian entered the
          crossing zone. Timers and logic thresholds were implemented to reduce false activations and ensure signals
          remained active for the duration of a crossing.

          A functional prototype was constructed using off-the-shelf components, with an emphasis on affordability and
          feasibility. The total prototype cost was approximately $105, demonstrating that meaningful safety
          improvements could be achieved without expensive infrastructure changes.

      <!-- TESTING -->
      <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
        <p class="principles-intro">
          The system was tested in real-world conditions across multiple pedestrian movement types, including walking,
          running, biking, and skateboarding. Testing showed approximately 80–90% detection accuracy, validating the
          sensing approach while highlighting opportunities for improvement through higher-grade sensors and improved
          placement.

        <p class="principles-close">
          While the prototype was not intended for permanent deployment, the project emphasized realistic engineering
          tradeoffs, including system reliability, human interpretation of signals, and potential liability concerns.
          Future improvements would focus on sensor redundancy, weatherproofing, and integration into existing urban
          infrastructure.
