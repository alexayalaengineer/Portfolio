        <h2 class="block-title">Overview &amp; Simulation Context</h2>

        <p class="principles-intro">
          This project involved developing a parametric MATLAB model to analyze and simulate the
          kinematics of a planar six-bar linkage. The mechanism was modeled in the context of a mobile
          Doppler radar truck, where a rotating mechanical linkage transitions the radar assembly between
          a driving configuration and an elevated scanning position. The goal of the simulation was to
          translate theoretical kinematic principles into a functional computational tool capable of
          calculating motion and visualizing system behavior over time.

      <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
        <h2 class="block-title">System Setup &amp; Kinematic Model</h2>

        <p class="principles-intro">
          The system is modeled as a constrained planar six-bar linkage with fixed pivots, rotating links,
          and dependent joints. Each link length, joint location, and reference angle is explicitly defined,
          allowing the mechanism geometry to be adjusted parametrically. Loop-closure relationships are
          used to enforce kinematic constraints between connected links.
        </p>

        <p class="principles-close">
          A labeled schematic of the linkage identifies each link, joint, and reference angle used in the
          analysis and serves as the foundation for the position, velocity, and acceleration calculations
          performed in MATLAB.
        </p>

      <!-- Computational Approach -->
      <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
        <h2 class="block-title">Computational Approach (MATLAB Implementation)</h2>

        <p class="principles-intro">
          The kinematic analysis is implemented entirely in MATLAB without reliance on pre-built
          mechanism toolboxes. Position analysis is performed using trigonometric relationships derived
          from loop-closure equations. Angular velocity and angular acceleration are then calculated
          analytically by differentiating the position equations with respect to time.
        </p>

        <p class="principles-close">
          The program is structured to progress logically from input definition to calculation to
          visualization. Arrays are used to store time-varying values for angular position, velocity,
          acceleration, and corresponding linear quantities. Modular code sections separate geometry
          setup, kinematic calculations, plotting routines, and animation logic, improving readability,
          debugging efficiency, and reusability.

        <h2 class="block-title">Simulation &amp; Animation Results</h2>

        <p class="principles-intro">
          An animated visualization of the six-bar mechanism is generated to demonstrate the continuous
          motion of the system over a full input rotation cycle. The animation shows the radar structure
          smoothly transitioning between configurations, validating the correctness of the kinematic
          relationships and constraints.

        <p class="principles-close">
          Still frames from the animation highlight key positions throughout the motion cycle. A full video
          of the simulation is available through the linked demonstration.

          In addition to animation, the model produces graphical outputs for angular and linear kinematic
          quantities. These include plots of angular position, angular velocity, and angular acceleration, as
          well as linear displacement, velocity, and acceleration of selected points on the mechanism.

          Three-dimensional plots are used where appropriate to visualize how motion variables evolve

          dynamic trends, peak accelerations, and regions of rapid motion that may influence mechanical
          design decisions.

        <h2 class="block-title">Learning Outcomes &amp; Engineering Takeaways</h2>

        <p class="principles-intro">
          This project reinforced my understanding of planar kinematics and the relationship between
          theoretical equations and real mechanical motion. Beyond the mathematics, it strengthened my
          ability to structure computational code, debug geometric constraints, and present complex motion
          in a clear and visual format.
        </p>

        <p class="principles-close">
          Most importantly, this experience demonstrated how an abstract mechanical concept can be
          transformed into a complete engineering deliverable — combining mathematical modeling,
          software implementation, and visual communication. The project deepened my confidence in
          using MATLAB as an engineering tool and highlighted the value of computational simulation in
          validating mechanical designs before physical prototyping.
