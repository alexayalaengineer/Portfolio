       KHALTSHA CYCLES — SUBPROJECT
  =============================== -->
  <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
    <p class="principles-intro">
      Khaltsha Cycles is a community-based bicycle shop located in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, founded to promote cycling as an accessible form of transportation, income generation, and recreation within township communities. The business operates as a one-stop bicycle hub, offering bike sales, repairs, rentals, training, and accessories while emphasizing affordability, community engagement, and social impact.

       DELIVERABLE 1

  <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
    <h2 class="block-title">Deliverable 1: Bookkeeping &amp; Financial Tracking System</h2>

    <p class="principles-intro">
      <strong>Problem.</strong> Khaltsha Cycles lacked a centralized, usable bookkeeping system. Sales, expenses, and invoices were spread across multiple platforms, making it difficult to track monthly performance, understand profitability, or support informed business decisions.
    </p>

    <p class="principles-intro">
      <strong>Solution.</strong> Our team designed and implemented a simple, centralized bookkeeping system using Google Drive and Google Sheets. The system organized invoices by month, tracked revenues and expenses in standardized journals, and automatically generated income statements. It was introduced directly to the owner and validated using real transaction data.
    </p>

    <p class="principles-close">
      <strong>Why this was the best solution.</strong> The system matched the client’s technical comfort level, required no paid software, and could be maintained independently. It prioritized clarity and usability over complexity, enabling immediate adoption and long-term sustainability.

       DELIVERABLE 2

  <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
    <h2 class="block-title">Deliverable 2: Marketing Strategy &amp; Brand Visibility</h2>

    <p class="principles-intro">
      <strong>Problem.</strong> Despite a strong location and social mission, Khaltsha Cycles struggled with visibility and customer awareness. Marketing efforts were inconsistent, and many potential customers did not clearly understand the services offered or the value of bicycles in daily life.
    </p>

    <p class="principles-intro">
      <strong>Solution.</strong> We developed a low-cost marketing strategy tailored to the local context. This included market segmentation, physical marketing materials, promotional content, and messaging focused on bicycles as tools for commuting, delivery, and health. Materials were designed for both in-store use and surrounding high–foot-traffic areas.
    </p>

    <p class="principles-close">
      <strong>Why this was the best solution.</strong> The approach aligned with the business’s limited budget while maximizing exposure in high-traffic areas. By connecting marketing directly to local needs and behaviors, the strategy emphasized relevance over scale.

       DELIVERABLE 3
  =============================== -->
  <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
    <h2 class="block-title">Deliverable 3: Pricing Strategy &amp; Inventory Systems</h2>

    <p class="principles-intro">
      <strong>Problem.</strong> All used bicycles were sold at a single flat price regardless of quality or condition, limiting affordability for some customers and reducing pricing flexibility. Additionally, there was no structured inventory system to track incoming bikes or analyze sales trends.
    </p>

    <p class="principles-intro">
      <strong>Solution.</strong> We created a value-based pricing structure with multiple price tiers aligned to customer segments. To support this system, we designed an inventory intake process using QR-enabled Google Forms connected to Google Sheets, allowing consistent data capture and basic inventory analytics.
    </p>

    <p class="principles-close">
      <strong>Why this was the best solution.</strong> The tiered pricing model improved accessibility without sacrificing profitability. The inventory system required minimal training, introduced data-driven decision-making, and laid the foundation for future pricing and sales analysis.

  <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
    <h2 class="block-title">Deliverable 4: Physical Branding &amp; Community Visibility</h2>

    <p class="principles-intro">
      <strong>Problem.</strong> The shop’s physical presence did not clearly communicate that bicycles were for sale, particularly to commuters passing by the mall and train station. This limited walk-in traffic despite a strong location.
    </p>

    <p class="principles-intro">
      <strong>Solution.</strong> We supported the creation of physical branding materials, including bike-for-sale signage, posters highlighting entry-level pricing, and community-based stencil branding placed throughout Khayelitsha. These efforts were paired with documentation for social media use.
    </p>

    <p class="principles-close">
      <strong>Why this was the best solution.</strong> Physical branding directly addressed the visibility gap in a cost-effective way. The approach reinforced brand recognition within the community and connected the business’s mission to its physical environment.
