          <h1>About</h1>

          <!-- ✅ Your existing professional paragraphs -->
          <p>
            I am a Mechatronics Engineering and MBA student at Middle Tennessee
            State University with experience supporting technical projects,
            coordinating multidisciplinary teams, and collaborating closely
            with students, faculty, and administrators.
          </p>

          <p>
            My background combines mechanical design, automation, and controls
            with project coordination, process improvement, and clear
            stakeholder communication. I am known for staying composed under
            pressure, organizing complex work into actionable plans, and
            translating technical ideas into practical outcomes that support
            projects from planning through execution.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through roles in engineering focused environments, project
            management, and international education, I have developed a strong
            appreciation for collaboration, accountability, and continuous
            improvement. I enjoy working at the intersection of technology,
            operations, and people in environments where structure, learning,
            and execution matter.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently seeking opportunities in engineering, operations,
            project coordination, or technical support roles where I can
            contribute technical insight, organizational strength, and a
            positive, solutions focused mindset.
          </p>

<!-- GUIDING PRINCIPLESSSSSSSS -->
    
<section class="info-block">
  <h2 class="block-title">Guiding Principles</h2>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    These principles shape how I work with teams, approach challenges, and build outcomes I’m proud of.
    They guide my decisions in both technical and leadership settings.
  </p>

  <div class="principles-stack">
    <!-- OWNERSHIP -->
    <div class="principle-row">
      <div class="principle-explain">
        <h3 class="principle-name">Take Ownership</h3>
        <p><em>Ownership: taking responsibility for outcomes, not just tasks.</em></p>
        <p>
          I believe progress happens when someone is willing to take responsibility for moving work forward.
          Ownership means being reliable, following through, and stepping in when something is unclear or stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, that looks like anticipating needs, communicating blockers early, and staying focused on results
          rather than excuses. I try to leave every team and project stronger than I found it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-define">
        <div class="principle-def">
          TAKE<br />OWNERSHIP
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- CURIOSITY (FLIP) -->
    <div class="principle-row flip">
      <div class="principle-define">
        <div class="principle-def">
          STAY<br />CURIOUS
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-explain">
        <h3 class="principle-name">Stay Curious</h3>
        <p><em>Curiosity: a desire to learn, explore, and understand.</em></p>
        <p>
          I’m motivated by learning how systems work and why problems happen. Curiosity helps me ask better questions,
          discover root causes, and spot opportunities to improve processes or design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether I’m learning a tool, digging into data, or listening to feedback from others, I try to approach
          challenges with an open mindset—because better solutions usually start with better understanding.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- COMMUNICATION -->
    <div class="principle-row">
      <div class="principle-explain">
        <h3 class="principle-name">Communicate with Clarity</h3>
        <p><em>Clarity: the quality of being coherent, understandable, and precise.</em></p>
        <p>
          Communication is essential to the success of any project or goal. While I am capable of working independently,
          I do my best work when collaborating with others and drawing on the collective knowledge of a team.
          True collaboration happens when ideas can be clearly expressed, understood, and built upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I view communication not as a natural gift, but as a skill that must be practiced and refined.
          I work intentionally to shape my thoughts into clear language so that complex ideas become accessible and actionable.
          Whether discussing technical concepts or coordinating across teams, I aim to ensure everyone shares a common understanding
          so progress is limited only by imagination rather than misunderstanding.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-define">
        <div class="principle-def">
          COMMUNICATE<br />WITH CLARITY
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- INTEGRITY (FLIP) -->
    <div class="principle-row flip">
      <div class="principle-define">
        <div class="principle-def">
          LEAD WITH<br />INTEGRITY
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-explain">
        <h3 class="principle-name">Lead with Integrity</h3>
        <p><em>Integrity: the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.</em></p>
        <p>
          Leading with integrity means committing to honesty, accountability, and consistency in both actions and decisions.
          I believe in playing the long game by building trust through ethical behavior and thoughtful decision-making,
          even when doing so requires patience or difficult choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          While no one is perfect, I try to continuously reflect on my actions and improve where I can.
          By holding myself to high standards, I aim to create positive environments rooted in fairness, respect, and responsibility.
          Leading with integrity helps me grow personally while also supporting and uplifting the people around me.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="principles-close">
    I try to apply these principles consistently—whether I’m supporting a project, working through a technical challenge,
    or collaborating with others toward a shared goal.
