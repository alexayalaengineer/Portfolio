      <p>
        I am a Mechatronics Engineering and MBA student at Middle Tennessee
        State University with experience supporting technical projects,
        coordinating multidisciplinary teams, and collaborating closely
        with students, faculty, and administrators.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background combines mechanical design, automation, and controls
        with project coordination, process improvement, and clear
        stakeholder communication. I am known for staying composed under
        pressure, organizing complex work into actionable plans, and
        translating technical ideas into practical outcomes that support
        projects from planning through execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through roles in engineering focused environments, project
        management, and international education, I have developed a strong
        appreciation for collaboration, accountability, and continuous
        improvement. I enjoy working at the intersection of technology,
        operations, and people in environments where structure, learning,
        and execution matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently seeking opportunities in engineering, operations,
        project coordination, or technical support roles where I can
        contribute technical insight, organizational strength, and a
        positive, solutions focused mindset.

<!-- GUIDING PRINCIPLESSSSSSSS -->
    
<section class="section-container info-block">
  <h2 class="block-title">Guiding Principles</h2>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    These principles guide how I think, work, and collaborate. They shape how I approach problems,
    communicate ideas, and show up in technical and professional environments.
  </p>

  <div class="principles-stack">

    <!-- INGENUITY -->
     <div class="principle-row ingenuity">
      <div class="principle-explain">
        <h3 class="principle-name">Design with Ingenuity</h3>

        <p>
          Designing with ingenuity means pushing beyond familiar solutions and being willing to rethink
          problems from the ground up. When I face challenges, it can be easy to rely on approaches that
          have already been tried. My strongest personal and professional work happens when I step
          outside of that comfort zone, learn from people who are more experienced than I am, and take
          time to truly redefine both the problem and the solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          By approaching challenges with curiosity and openness, I aim to create solutions that are not
          only functional but thoughtful and original. Ingenuity, to me, is about creativity,
          adaptability, and a commitment to continuous learning in pursuit of better outcomes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-define">
        <div class="principle-def">
          Ingenuity: the quality of being clever, original, and inventive.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- CLARITY -->
    <div class="principle-row clarity flip">
      <div class="principle-define">
        <div class="principle-def">
          Clarity: the quality of being coherent, understandable, and precise.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-explain">
        <h3 class="principle-name">Communicate with Clarity</h3>

        <p>
          Communication is essential to the success of any project or goal. While I am capable of
          working independently, I do my best work when collaborating with others and drawing on the
          collective knowledge of a team. True collaboration happens when ideas can be clearly
          expressed, understood, and built upon.
        </p>

        <p>
          I view communication not as a natural gift, but as a skill that must be practiced and refined.
          I work intentionally to shape my thoughts into clear language so that complex ideas become
          accessible and actionable. Whether discussing technical concepts or coordinating across
          teams, I strive to ensure everyone shares a common understanding, allowing progress to be
          limited only by imagination rather than misunderstanding.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- INTEGRITY -->
    <div class="principle-row integrity">
      <div class="principle-explain">
        <h3 class="principle-name">Lead with Integrity</h3>

        <p>
          Leading with integrity means committing to honesty, accountability, and consistency in both
          actions and decisions. I believe in playing the long game by building trust through ethical
          behavior and thoughtful decision making, even when doing so requires patience or difficult
          choices.
        </p>

        <p>
          While no one is perfect, I strive to continuously reflect on my actions and improve where I
          can. By holding myself to high standards, I aim to create positive environments rooted in
          fairness, respect, and responsibility. Leading with integrity allows me not only to grow
          personally, but also to support and uplift those around me.

  <!-- HOBBIES SECTION -->
<section class="hobbies-block">
  <h2 class="block-title">Hobbies</h2>

  <p class="hobbies-intro">
    Outside of school, I enjoy staying active in interests that challenge me, spark curiosity, and keep life exciting. These hobbies allow me to explore creativity, problem solving, and personal growth in ways that complement my academic and professional work.
  </p>

  <div class="hobbies-grid">
    <!-- Travel -->
    <article class="hobby-card">
      <h3 class="hobby-title">Travel</h3>
      <div class="hobby-text">
         <p>
        After studying abroad in the summer of 2022, I caught a serious case of the travel bug. I quickly fell in love with travel in a nontraditional sense. Rather than luxury hotels or polished itineraries, I am drawn to backpacking, staying in hostels, meeting new people, and finding meaningful experiences on a tight budget.
           </p>
               <p>
To me, travel is less about destinations and more about connection. It is about shared stories, unexpected friendships, and experiences that challenge my perspective. The imperfect moments often become the most memorable, whether it is navigating unfamiliar places, sharing meals with locals, or learning from people whose lives look very different from my own.

    <!-- Cars -->
    <article class="hobby-card">
      <h3 class="hobby-title">Cars</h3>
      <div class="hobby-text">
        <p>
        Cars have fascinated me for as long as I can remember. My family likes to joke that I could recognize makes and models before I could name extended relatives. As I got older, that curiosity turned into hands on experience, from taking apart my own vehicles to learning how systems work together mechanically and electrically.
        </p>
        <p>
        That curiosity eventually grew into a love for road trips and finding excuses to take the long way home. A few years ago, I even parted out a Mazda Miata as a learning experience and small side project. Working on cars has taught me patience, problem solving, and how complex systems rely on simple fundamentals working in harmony.

    <!-- Music -->
    <article class="hobby-card">
      <h3 class="hobby-title">Music</h3>
      <div class="hobby-text">
        <p>
        Music has been a constant part of my life since middle school. I played trombone and baritone in both concert and marching band, where I learned discipline, teamwork, and how individual contributions come together to create something larger than any one person. Those early experiences taught me how structure, timing, and collaboration shape meaningful outcomes.
</p>
        <p>
        Toward the end of high school, I picked up guitar and began exploring music more independently. Since then, music has become a personal creative outlet and a way to express ideas and emotions that are sometimes difficult to put into words. Occasionally, with a bit of encouragement from friends, I will play original songs or covers in small live settings.
</p>
        <p>
        What I enjoy most about music is its ability to slow things down and create space for reflection. Whether I am listening, writing, or playing, music helps me process experiences, reset my focus, and think more clearly. It allows creativity and emotion to coexist with structure, rhythm, and intention, making it both grounding and energizing at the same time.

    <article class="hobby-card">
      <h3 class="hobby-title">Storm Chasing</h3>
      <div class="hobby-text">
       <p>
        My interest in weather began early, sparked by watching storm documentaries and learning about severe weather while growing up in the Midwest. Tornadoes in particular captured my attention because of their power, complexity, and unpredictability. Over time, that curiosity developed into a deeper interest in meteorology and the science behind how severe weather forms and evolves.
</p>
        <p>
        As I got older, I began studying forecasting techniques and safely traveling to observe storms and capture photographs. I am especially interested in how data, pattern recognition, and real time decision making come together in weather science. Storms represent a powerful intersection of nature, uncertainty, and analysis, and studying them has strengthened my appreciation for preparation, observation, and respect for complex systems.
</p>
        <p>
       Through this interest, I have learned to think critically under changing conditions, remain patient in uncertain environments, and balance curiosity with caution while embracing the sense of adventure that comes with exploring complex and unpredictable systems.
