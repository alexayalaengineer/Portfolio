      <p>
        I am a Mechatronics Engineering and MBA student at Middle Tennessee
        State University with experience supporting technical projects,
        coordinating multidisciplinary teams, and collaborating closely
        with students, faculty, and administrators.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background combines mechanical design, automation, and controls
        with project coordination, process improvement, and clear
        stakeholder communication. I am known for staying composed under
        pressure, organizing complex work into actionable plans, and
        translating technical ideas into practical outcomes that support
        projects from planning through execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through roles in engineering focused environments, project
        management, and international education, I have developed a strong
        appreciation for collaboration, accountability, and continuous
        improvement. I enjoy working at the intersection of technology,
        operations, and people in environments where structure, learning,
        and execution matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently seeking opportunities in engineering, operations,
        project coordination, or technical support roles where I can
        contribute technical insight, organizational strength, and a
        positive, solutions focused mindset.

<!-- GUIDING PRINCIPLESSSSSSSS -->
    
<section class="section-container info-block">
  <h2 class="block-title">Guiding Principles</h2>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    These principles guide how I think, work, and collaborate. They shape how I approach problems,
    communicate ideas, and show up in technical and professional environments.
  </p>

  <div class="principles-stack">

    <!-- INGENUITY -->
    <div class="principle-row">
      <div class="principle-explain">
        <h3 class="principle-name">Design with Ingenuity</h3>

        <p>
          Designing with ingenuity means pushing beyond familiar solutions and being willing to rethink
          problems from the ground up. When I face challenges, it can be easy to rely on approaches that
          have already been tried. My strongest personal and professional work happens when I step
          outside of that comfort zone, learn from people who are more experienced than I am, and take
          time to truly redefine both the problem and the solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          By approaching challenges with curiosity and openness, I aim to create solutions that are not
          only functional but thoughtful and original. Ingenuity, to me, is about creativity,
          adaptability, and a commitment to continuous learning in pursuit of better outcomes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-define">
        <div class="principle-def">
          Ingenuity: the quality of being clever, original, and inventive.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- CLARITY -->
    <div class="principle-row flip">
      <div class="principle-define">
        <div class="principle-def">
          Clarity: the quality of being coherent, understandable, and precise.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-explain">
        <h3 class="principle-name">Communicate with Clarity</h3>

        <p>
          Communication is essential to the success of any project or goal. While I am capable of
          working independently, I do my best work when collaborating with others and drawing on the
          collective knowledge of a team. True collaboration happens when ideas can be clearly
          expressed, understood, and built upon.
        </p>

        <p>
          I view communication not as a natural gift, but as a skill that must be practiced and refined.
          I work intentionally to shape my thoughts into clear language so that complex ideas become
          accessible and actionable. Whether discussing technical concepts or coordinating across
          teams, I strive to ensure everyone shares a common understanding, allowing progress to be
          limited only by imagination rather than misunderstanding.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- INTEGRITY -->
    <div class="principle-row">
      <div class="principle-explain">
        <h3 class="principle-name">Lead with Integrity</h3>

        <p>
          Leading with integrity means committing to honesty, accountability, and consistency in both
          actions and decisions. I believe in playing the long game by building trust through ethical
          behavior and thoughtful decision making, even when doing so requires patience or difficult
          choices.
        </p>

        <p>
          While no one is perfect, I strive to continuously reflect on my actions and improve where I
          can. By holding myself to high standards, I aim to create positive environments rooted in
          fairness, respect, and responsibility. Leading with integrity allows me not only to grow
          personally, but also to support and uplift those around me.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-define">
        <div class="principle-def">
          Integrity: the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

  <p class="principles-close">
    These principles guide how I approach engineering, collaboration, and professional growth, and
    they shape the way I contribute to every project I am part of.
