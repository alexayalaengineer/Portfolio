        <p class="cred-text">
          Pursuing an MBA alongside my engineering degree allows me to strengthen the leadership, strategic, and decision-making skills that complement technical work. The program emphasizes strategy, operations, finance, and organizational leadership, helping me understand how technical efforts scale within real organizations. By combining business education with engineering, I am developing the ability to evaluate tradeoffs, communicate across technical and non-technical teams, and contribute to decisions that balance performance, people, and long-term impact. This path supports my goal of working at the intersection of engineering execution and organizational leadership.

        <p class="cred-text">
          Mechatronics Engineering integrates mechanical systems, electronics, controls, and software to design complete, intelligent systems. The program emphasizes hands-on learning, system-level thinking, and real-world problem solving. Through coursework and projects, I’ve gained experience with circuits, sensors, automation, control systems, and mechanical design, learning how hardware and software work together in practice. I chose mechatronics because it reflects how modern engineering problems are solved — at the intersection of multiple disciplines — and because I enjoy building systems that interact with the physical world.

          This degree focuses on how organizations operate across cultures, industries, and global contexts. Coursework emphasized communication, leadership, organizational behavior, and professional collaboration. A key component was participation in the EESA Study Abroad program, where I worked with entrepreneurs in South Africa and later returned as a program coordinator. These experiences strengthened my ability to work across cultures, support teams, and adapt in complex environments. This background complements my engineering education by adding a people-centered, global perspective to problem-solving and leadership.
